## Follow a Consistent Coding Style

This project adheres to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) rules where it does not impact readability.

Some general guidelines:
- `snake_case` for variable and module names
- `camelCase` for function and method names
- `PascalCase` for class and object names
- Try to adhere to a 79 character character line limit

Where readability can be improved, however, exceptions can of course be made.
For example, module names for effects should use `PascalCase` rather than `snake_case` to keep the same name as its main class.
